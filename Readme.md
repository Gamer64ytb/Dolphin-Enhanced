Discontinued Project
=============================================

PLS, DONT take this as a new Dolphin fork, because its dead.

My android development ended since July. I got a Steam deck and now I am no longer developing for android anymore.
I wanna say that thanks a lot for these ppl who liked my work! And these ppl that hated my projects (a lot), learn how to appreciate the free and open source work of another ppl, idiot.
It was a regular travel, I regret of some things but it was cool on part. I know I released too many dumb projects and I am sorry if I caused shit accidentally (Especially to @JosJuice, one of dolphin emulator devs).
, man!

A big thanks for a special guy
I want give a huge thanks to @Bankaimaster999. This guy helped and supported some of my idiotic things since Day 1, and he teached me about Android Studio on first days. I am glad of meet guys like him, and I hope that his work goes well! Thanks for everything man
Also thanks to MrSujano (I don't have his GitHub) for all content that he uploads about! He helps a lot for Android and PC community. Hes a very good guy :)
Note!

I left android, but I may make work for PC soon! (2024/2025), this time with head. I won't make forks anymore.
